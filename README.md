Final project of the discipline "Fundamentals of Image Processing".
In this project, I implemented an algorithm that is capable of blurring an image but preserving the edges.
The implementation is based on a scientific paper called "Domain Transform for Edge-Aware Image and Video Processing", more informations can be found on: /https://www.inf.ufrgs.br/~eslgastal/DomainTransform/
